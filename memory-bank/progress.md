# Progress: Personal Finance Management System

## What Works
- Project documentation established including application flow, implementation plan, and technology stack.
- Core project brief, product context, system patterns, and technical context drafted and saved.
- Clear understanding of project phases and technical architecture.
- Database schema versioning with migration support implemented up to version 4, including:
  - fieldMappings table for saving import configurations
  - Compound index for efficient duplicate detection
  - Imports table for tracking import sessions
- Database utilities for initialization, version detection, and validation created.
- Application initialization with proper database setup and error handling.
- Comprehensive test coverage for all existing application code.
- Transaction import functionality including:
  - CSV parsing with header detection
  - Field mapping with auto-detection and saved configurations
  - Transaction preview before import
  - Import service with duplicate detection
  - Transaction deduplication (detection, removal, and merging)
  - Support for multiple transaction types (income, expense, Capital Transfer, Capital Inflow, True Expense, etc.)
- UI components for CSV upload, field mapping, and transaction preview.
- Dashboard components for financial reporting, including summary cards and charts for income vs expenses, category breakdown, and spending distribution.

## What's Left to Build
- Refinement of transaction import and categorization features.
- User interface for managing duplicate transactions.
- Development of capital asset tracking and depreciation functionality.
- Creation of virtual sinking funds management.
- Building of dual-view accounting engine and reporting tools.
- UI/UX design and refinement for responsive and accessible interfaces.
- Testing, optimization, and launch preparations.

## Current Status
- Project planning and documentation phase completed.
- Database infrastructure with versioning support implemented.
- Test infrastructure established with comprehensive coverage of existing code.
- Transaction import pipeline implemented with UI, services, and deduplication.
- Dashboard development in progress.
- Testing strategy implemented to ensure all future features include test coverage.
- Ready to proceed with core feature development as outlined in the implementation plan.

## Known Issues
- None identified at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Adopted offline-first architecture with IndexedDB for local data storage.
- Chose React with TypeScript and Vite for frontend development.
- Selected AG Grid Community and Apache ECharts for data grid and visualization needs.
- Emphasized modular design and dual-view accounting as core differentiators.
- Implemented comprehensive testing strategy with Vitest for all application components.
- Established test-driven development approach for new features.
- Implemented versioned database schema with explicit migration functions.
- Created database utilities for initialization and validation.
- Added application initialization with proper database setup and error handling.
- Expanded transaction types to support dual-view accounting concepts.
- Added compound indexes for efficient data querying and duplicate detection.
- Implemented transaction deduplication strategies to maintain data integrity.
- Created import session tracking to provide users with import history and statistics.
