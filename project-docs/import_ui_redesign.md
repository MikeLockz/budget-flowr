# Import UI Redesign

This document outlines the changes made to improve the transaction import workflow.

## Overview

The import functionality has been redesigned with a better user experience and more robust workflow. Key improvements include:

- Dedicated Import section with URL-based routing
- Multi-step workflow with progress indicator
- Separate tabs for Import Data and Import History
- Enhanced UI with clearer feedback and better organization
- Drag-and-drop file upload support
- Improved field mapping interface
- Transaction preview tabs for easier data validation
- Success confirmation screen with import stats

## Architecture Changes

### New Navigation Structure

- Added TanStack Router for navigation
- Created dedicated `/import` and `/import/history` routes
- Updated sidebar with "Utilities" section containing Import link

### Component Structure

New components:
- `ImportStepper`: Progress indicator for the import workflow
- `ImportSuccess`: Success confirmation screen with import statistics
- `pages/import/index.tsx`: Main import page with tabs
- `pages/import/import-data.tsx`: Import data workflow
- `pages/import/import-history.tsx`: Import history display

Updated components:
- `CSVUpload`: Enhanced with drag-and-drop support and better feedback
- `FieldMappingUI`: Redesigned with Shadcn UI components
- `TransactionPreview`: Added tabs for mapped data, raw data, and skipped rows

## Import Workflow

The new import process follows these steps:

1. **Select File**
   - Drag-and-drop CSV file or browse to select
   - Click Parse CSV to proceed

2. **Map Fields**
   - Match CSV columns to transaction fields
   - Configure import options (date format, amount handling)
   - Save/load mapping configurations
   - Generate preview

3. **Preview**
   - View mapped transactions
   - Examine original data
   - Review skipped rows with issues
   - Import transactions

4. **Confirmation**
   - Success screen with statistics
   - Options to go to Dashboard or view Import History

## Import History

The Import History tab shows all past imports with:
- Date and time
- File name
- Row statistics (total, imported, duplicates, updated, skipped)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

1. CSV file is parsed with PapaParse
2. User-defined or auto-detected field mapping is applied
3. Transactions are mapped based on configuration
4. Duplicate detection is performed
5. Database insertion/update happens
6. Import session is recorded for history

### Interface Updates

- Added Shadcn UI components for consistent styling
- Implemented responsive designs for all screens
- Enhanced form components with better validation feedback
- Added loading states and error handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. Account selection during import
2. Category mapping/creation during import
3. Rules-based transaction categorization
4. Bulk editing of transactions before import
5. Import from bank API connections
6. Export capabilities for transaction data
